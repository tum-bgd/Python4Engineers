    "The most simple usage is the if statement, followed by a condition and a colon. The conditional statements follow in a **block**. The statements inside the block are only executed, when the condition is (evaluated to) `True`. The most significant difference between Python and other languages is the **mandatory indentation of blocks**. Blocks are grouped statements (e.g. used in loops, conditions or functions). The following cell will demonstrate the indentation syntax. `if` introduces a block. Usually the indentation size is four spaces. Most IDEs (also the Jupyter server) will convert tabs to spaces so we can use tabs as well. \n",
    "A simple indentation rule is: Whenever a statement ends with a colon, (at least) the next non-blank line has to be indented."
