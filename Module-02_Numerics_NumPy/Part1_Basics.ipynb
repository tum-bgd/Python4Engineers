    "NumPy (**Num**erical **Py**thon) is an open source Python library thatâ€™s widely used in science and engineering[^1]. For example, you can use it for working with vectors, matrices, linear algebra, optimization and much more. Behind the scene it relies on C++ libraries for numeric calculations. It is comparably fast as it is designed around Python's buffer interface which means that for many operations that one can do, no data is being copied."

    "### The `ndarray` data model\n",
    "\n",
    "The central data structure in NumPy is the `ndarray` object. It encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous types. Classical computers have a linear main memory. That is, somehow, we can have memory space for one or more variables of the same type, say N numbers, but we cannot (initially) have a memory for a 3x3 matrix. The nD-array data structure is now a wrapper which *internally* reserves spaces for a certain number of values, but is associated with shape and stride information telling, how this 1D array of values is going to be interpreted as a n-dimensional array. Some aspects (e.g., strides) are not visible from Python, so we will ignore them for now, but the shape is an important concept.\n",
