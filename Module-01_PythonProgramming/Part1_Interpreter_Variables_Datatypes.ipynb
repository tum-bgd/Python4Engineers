    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language where the code is executed line by line. Compiled languages such as C++ and Go on the other hand require to compile the entire project before anythin can be run. Interpreted languages are often used in a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) where the Python is read, dynamically evaluated by the interpreter into machine code for execution, and upon execution prints out the result. That is to say, we can program **interactively** using Python, just like this notebook. Actually, the current jupyter notebook we are using is such an interactive shell with a user-friendly interface running in a browser. To execute a code block, select it and then use the hotkey `shift`+`enter` to execute it. Let's try this in the next block."
