    "# Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is intended to give an introduction to the Python programming language. It focuses on giving a brief overview of basic language concepts to enable the audience to use it to solve computational tasks and problems. It is not considered a comprehensive coverage of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This module requires a working Jupyter environment to actively execute the code blocks and solve small programming tasks and exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The module is presented as a set of Jupyter notebooks that includes some exercises and tasks for self-learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After this module, you should have learned and be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- run and edit a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- be familiar with Python syntax\n",
    "- write and execute mathematical expressions\n",
    "- handle conditional code execution\n",
    "- apply control flow with loops\n",
    "- know collection data types and how to use them\n",
    "- understand how to use functions to structure your program\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1: Interpreters, variables and primitive data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3: Control flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 4: Collection data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 5: Functions, modules, and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 6: Advanced patterns (classes, coroutines, iterators)\n"
